# TypeScript MERN Starter

> **Note!** This project is still **under construction**, but it has already been working well. You can go to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section and have a try.

This project is intended to build a RESTful MERN start point in TypeScript. With this project as a start point you can easily extend it to a community or blog app.

MERN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications. The MERN stack is composed of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. 

This project implemented MERN in **TypeScript**. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript. It has become popular recently in applications due to the benefits it can bring. 
If you are new to TypeScript it is highly recommended to become familiar with it first before proceeding. You can check out its documentation [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html).

TypeScript has brought the following benefits to MERN:

- **Unified modeling** across web client and server for objects
- Type safety, and easy refactoring of typed code across web client and server
- A superior developer experience in a team environment

Not only using TypeScript, but this project is also featured by:

- **[RESTful-style](https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/whatisrest.html)**, powered by an embedded [oauth2 server](https://github.com/jaredhanson/oauth2orize) and [passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/), this project separate client and server clearly.
- **[React-router 4.0](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)**, with it you can easily define client routes and manage them.
- **[Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction)**, with it you can easily manage client states.
- **Almost ready** for a community app. We modelled ```User``` as well as ```Post```. This is a **real starter**  for who would like to build an community app on MERN.
- The client code is created from [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/), so now you can get rid of annoying configurations for babel and webpack.

# Motivation

(constructing...)

# Quick Start

## Prerequisite
To build and run this app locally you will need a few things:
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/shanhuiyang/TypeScript-MERN-Starter.git <project_name>
```
## Install dependencies
```
cd <project_name>
npm run update
```
## Start your mongoDB server
(you'll probably have to start another command prompt)
```
mongod
```
## Build and run the project
```
npm run start
```
Finally, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see the template being served and rendered locally!

# Road Map
We would like to extend this project from MERN to MERRN, another R stands for ReactNative. TypeScript will show the power of modeling in a **real fullstack** web app.
